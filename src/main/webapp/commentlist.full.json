In Danny Boyles 'Sunshine', they have a CG scene of Mercury passing between them and the sun. It looks exactly like what we saw this week. Maybe I am looking for another excuse to wear my tinfoil hat, but what happens if in order to get attention companies like NASA start simply releasing artistic impression as real ones? 50s through 80's saw drawings and artistic work used to help us gain a prospective of Science. Now it can fool us into thinking things exist.",
